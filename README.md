An implementation of Forward warning collision system and lane assist in MATLAB for the vehicle controlled by ROS

<b>Abstract : </b>

The following thesis discusses a section of the parent project, focusing on the development of an Autonomous Controller for a driverless car. The primary aim is to design an Automated Driving System with lane assist and forward-collision warning system which could be run successfully on IIT Delhi roads. Designed algorithms, used preexisting libraries on MATLAB, and then also integrated it with ROS for live communication. Gazebo simulation systems, video sources, and even live video feed was used for testing some of the algorithms and the qualitative comparison of the designed models. The main target is to exploit the capabilities of MATLAB and use its inbuilt libraries, models, and algorithms to achieve the desired output and control signals.

<b>Overview</b>

For this undergraduate thesis, the aim is to design a vision based assist system capable of controlling the e2o car autonomously, keeping the stereo camera as the global sensor. The idea is to use the technology which is developed by Mathworks and mold it according to the required needs. Initially, the focus was on understanding and working on the MATLAB vision toolbox, but later, the approach was diversified. The algorithms were tested on simulation and real-world videos. ROS-MATLAB framework was also explored to integrate the results and outputs to control the car


<b> Implementation : Forward Collision Warning System </b>

1. Using the MATLAB Camera callibration toolbox, calibrate the camera to get the intrinsic and extrinsic properties
