An implementation of Forward warning collision system and lane assist in MATLAB for the vehicle controlled by ROS

Abstract

The following thesis discusses a section of the parent project, focusing on the development of an Autonomous Controller for a driverless car. The primary aim is to design an Automated Driving System with lane assist and forward-collision warning system which could be run successfully on IIT Delhi roads. Designed algorithms, used preexisting libraries on MATLAB, and then also integrated it with ROS for live communication. Gazebo simulation systems, video sources, and even live video feed was used for testing some of the algorithms and the qualitative comparison of the designed models. The main target is to exploit the capabilities of MATLAB and use its inbuilt libraries, models, and algorithms to achieve the desired output and control signals.
