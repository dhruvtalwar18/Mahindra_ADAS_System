An implementation of Forward warning collision system and lane assist in MATLAB for the vehicle controlled by ROS

<b><h1>Abstract</h1></b>

The following thesis discusses a section of the parent project, focusing on the development of an Autonomous Controller for a driverless car. The primary aim is to design an Automated Driving System with lane assist and forward-collision warning system which could be run successfully on IIT Delhi roads. Designed algorithms, used preexisting libraries on MATLAB, and then also integrated it with ROS for live communication. Gazebo simulation systems, video sources, and even live video feed was used for testing some of the algorithms and the qualitative comparison of the designed models. The main target is to exploit the capabilities of MATLAB and use its inbuilt libraries, models, and algorithms to achieve the desired output and control signals.

<b><h1>Overview</h1></b>

For this undergraduate thesis, the aim is to design a vision based assist system capable of controlling the e2o car autonomously, keeping the stereo camera as the global sensor. The idea is to use the technology which is developed by Mathworks and mold it according to the Indian roads, in our experiements we rested tested the algorithm on the IIT Delhi campus roads. Initially, the focus was on understanding and working on the MATLAB vision toolbox, but later, the approach was diversified. The algorithms were tested on simulation and real-world videos. Using the ROS-MATLAB bridge the outputs generated by the algorithms were relayed to control the car.


<b><h1> Implementation : Forward Collision Warning System </h1></b>
The forward warning collision system will take in live video from the monocular camera, and give the world coordinates of the vehicle as well as the pedestrian wrt the Ego vehicle. In case a vehicle or pedestrian is very close i.e within 2 car lengths that is between 1.5- 3 meters, the Ego vehicle brakes will be deployed by sending brake msgs over the MATLAB-ROS bridge.


1. Using the MATLAB Camera callibration toolbox, calibrate the camera to get the intrinsic and extrinsic properties 
2. Feed the found properties to the MATLAB code(Final_car.m) 
3. Give the correct Video path on which the code is to be run and run the code 
 
MATLAB 2019b was used for the generation of the result below

In a pedestrian or a vehicle comes closer to the Ego vehicle than the safe distance set(cuurently set as 2m), the algorithm would send braking commands to the ROS master on the ROS topic /E2OCtrl
And the detection would appear in red bounding boxes, Refer Fig. 3

<b><h1> Implementation : Lane Assist System </h1></b>
The Lane assist system using the same input from the monocular camera will detect lanes and output the steering angles that is required by the vehicle to drive in between of the lanes. The steering angle generated form the code would then be published to the same topic that is /E2OCtrl using which the vehicle would steer itself. We incorporated 2 different techniques, that is linear lane detection, i.e lanes will be detected as straight lines and the other is parabolic lane detection in which the detected lane would curve with the lane as a 2nd degree polynomial.

1. Using the MATLAB Camera callibration toolbox, calibrate the camera to get the intrinsic and extrinsic properties 
2. Feed the found properties to the MATLAB code(INSERT CODE.m) 
3. Give the correct Video path on which the code is to be run and run the code
